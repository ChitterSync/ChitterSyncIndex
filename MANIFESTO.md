# ChitterSync Community Manifesto  
### A Declaration of Digital Independence

We’re done playing by the rules of the surveillance web.  
We’re done with platforms that treat people like data mines.  
We’re done watching speech get strangled and creativity throttled.  
The internet belongs to *us*. Not corporations. Not governments. *Us.*

**ChitterSync exists to reclaim that freedom.**

We are not here to be another social network.  
We are here to build a new digital nation—one built on respect, privacy, and power in the hands of the people.

## We Believe in These Rights — Unconditionally:

**1. You own your data.**  
Everything you post, create, and share is yours. We don’t touch it, sell it, or monetize it.

**2. You have the right to privacy.**  
We will never track you, profile you, or spy on your activity. Your digital life stays *yours*.

**3. You have the right to speak freely.**  
Ideas should be debated, not deleted. You have a voice here—use it.

**4. You have the right to anonymity.**  
No names, no faces, no forced ID checks. You are who you say you are.

**5. You have the right to leave.**  
No lock-ins. No dark patterns. Take your data and go if you want. We’ll respect it.

**6. You have the right to transparency.**  
Every rule, every decision, every policy is public and accountable. No more “trust us”—we’ll show you.

**7. You have the right to say no.**  
No forced ads, no behavioral tracking, no manipulative nudging. You control your experience.

**8. You have the right to resist surveillance.**  
We don’t work with law enforcement unless human lives are at risk.  
We don’t comply with vague court orders. We fight for you.

**9. You have the right to export everything.**  
Full data portability—messages, files, profiles, servers. It’s yours, and you can take it.

**10. You have the right to contribute.**  
This isn’t our platform. It’s yours. Build with us. Speak up. Shape the future.

We are not neutral.  
We stand for **freedom**.  
We stand for **privacy**.  
We stand for the **users**—and we always will.
