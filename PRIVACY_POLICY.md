# Reach Studios Global Privacy Policy  
### Covers: ChitterSync, Gia, ChitterHaven, Velosync, PreCorded, CommunityForge, and all related services.  
**Version 1.0 – Effective Immediately**

We’re not Big Tech.  
We’re not ad companies dressed up as social platforms.  
We don’t make money by watching you.

We built this ecosystem to give you a real alternative—to fight the system that treats users like cattle and content like currency.  
So here’s how we handle your privacy: with **respect, transparency, and zero bullshit.**

---

## 1. What This Covers

This policy applies to:

- **ChitterSync** – our social platform
- **Gia** – our content publishing network
- **ChitterHaven** – our community/server system
- **Velosync** – our file and content sync platform
- **PreCorded** – our AI and automation toolkit
- **CommunityForge** – our migration + server builder tool
- And **any other future service** under Reach Studios

If it’s in our ecosystem, this policy applies.

---

## 2. What We Collect (and Why)

Only what’s necessary to make stuff *work*. Not to track, profile, or profit.

We may collect:

- **Username, Email (Optional)**: For account creation, support, and recovery.
- **Passwords**: Securely hashed. We can’t see them. Don’t reuse them.
- **Content You Post**: Messages, uploads, profiles, etc. We store it so you can use it. That’s it.
- **Server Activity (ChitterHaven/CommunityForge)**: For moderation *you control*. We don’t snoop.
- **Files (Velosync)**: Yours, encrypted and untouched unless you say otherwise.
- **Bot Activity (PreCorded)**: AI data stays in your space. No training, no selling, no scraping.

**NO IP logging.  
NO fingerprinting.  
NO 3rd-party tracking scripts.  
NO surveillance analytics.**

We don’t track where you go. We don’t care.

---

## 3. What We NEVER Do

Let’s make it crystal clear:

- We don’t sell your data  
- We don’t mine your behavior  
- We don’t listen to your mic, read your camera, or inject spyware  
- We don’t embed Facebook/Google/TikTok scripts  
- We don’t participate in data-sharing agreements or AI training programs  
- We don’t use invasive ads or shadow analytics

If we need to process something (like bug reports or server logs), it stays in-house, encrypted, and temporary.

---

## 4. Law Enforcement & Government Requests

Let’s be blunt:  
We do **not** work with law enforcement unless it’s an active threat to human life.

We don’t hand over logs, DMs, or files unless someone’s in serious danger.  
Even if there’s a court order, we will challenge it if it’s vague, overreaching, or violates your rights.

We’re not their data vault.  
We’re not their surveillance tool.  
We’re here for **you**—not them.

If we ever have to comply, and we’re allowed to tell you, we’ll notify you fast.

---

## 5. Cookies & Web Tech

We only use essential cookies:

- To keep you logged in
- To remember your theme/settings
- To avoid rate limits or spam

No ads.  
No tracking.  
No cookie popups full of lies.

---

## 6. Third-Party Tools & Integrations

Sometimes we use third-party tools (for storage, auth, or backup), but we:

- Vet every one for privacy and security
- Never allow silent data collection
- Provide opt-out or clear disclosure where possible

If a service steps out of line, it’s gone. Period.

---

## 7. Your Rights as a User

Here’s what you get by default:

- **Right to Anonymity** – Use our services with minimal ID.
- **Right to Portability** – Download all your data any time.
- **Right to Deletion** – Nuke your account and content with one click.
- **Right to View** – See what we store. It’s not much, and you deserve to know.
- **Right to Say No** – Decline future changes that impact your privacy.
- **Right to Encryption** – We secure everything we store.

---

## 8. Minors

We are not a playground.  
If you're under the age of digital consent in your country, don’t use our services without a guardian’s permission.  
We don’t knowingly collect kid data, and if we find it—we delete it immediately.

---

## 9. Policy Changes

We don’t do silent edits.  
If we ever update this policy, we’ll announce it loud and clear.  
No dark patterns. No sneaky opt-ins. You’ll know, and you’ll have control.

---

**Privacy is a right, not a privilege.**  
We don’t ask for your trust—we **earn** it.  
And we defend it, every damn day.
